generate your passwords without scrolling through a text file

There are many apps and services online for making diceware passwords. This one is so simple you can verify yourself with minimals skills that it isn't sending you shiny new password straight to East Whereverlandia. I have kept the physical dice element in this process just use this to search through the wordlist. A paper list in a cave is probably safer, so don't use this if you are Edward Snowden, but if you were gonna Cmd+F anyway, I think it makes no difference.

The script is adjustable to different length requirements and uses the EFF wordlist.

If you would like to run it I can give you the instructions on a Mac, I suspect it is similar on other platforms. 

1. Open Terminal
2. Type `python3` and a space
3. Drag and drop the Python file, this will paste in it's address
4. Press Enter
5. If you would like to run it again just press the up arrow and enter again
